# What is this project?

The project aims to address societal conflicts in less fortunate parts of the world by predicting and preparing for potential escalations. Evan Wheeler and UNICEF are utilizing statistical and data science methods to create three predictive models: 
 - a transformer-based deep learning language model (similar to ChatGPT)
 - a small feed-forward neural network (a simplified brain-inspired system)
 - xgboost gradient boosting machine learning model (the machine learning "gold standard")
 
Predicting regions most prone to conflict allows UNICEF to proactively ready resources, offering vital aid such as food and shelter, and aiding affected individuals in reconstructing their lives.

# Methods

Our analysis is conducted using hypothesis testing, linear regression and general interpretation.
